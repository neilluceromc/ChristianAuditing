# Inventory v2 — Session Handover

**Last updated:** 2026-08-18 · **Phase 7 is MID-FLIGHT on branch `phase-7-offboarding`, 13 commits ahead of main** · **Phases 1–6 merged; Phase 7 tasks 1–6 of 15 done; Phase 8 remains.**

This is the pick-up doc for a fresh session. Read this first, then the spec
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-14-inventory-v2-design.md`) and the two design-handover files
(`design_handover/original-brief.md` = what each screen does; `design_handover/README.md` = how it
looks + tokens). The client's 39 routes are enumerated in the brief §7; 27 pages + 4 route handlers
exist today.

---

## 0. Start here (next session, in order)

1. **`git checkout phase-7-offboarding`** — do NOT start from main. The branch is 13 commits ahead and
   nothing is merged yet. `git status` should be clean.
2. `docker compose up -d db` → **`npx prisma migrate deploy`** (this branch adds a 7th migration) →
   `npm run db:seed` → open the preview (`preview_start` name `app-dev`).
3. Read **§6** — the Phase 7 plan is complete and being executed task-by-task, and §6 carries both the
   progress marker and the invariants the finished tasks established. Later tasks break if you don't
   know them.
4. **Resume at Task 7** of `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-phase-7-offboarding.md` with
   `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`. Tasks 1–6 are committed; 7–15 remain. The plan is
   **15 tasks and has been amended after every review**, so it matches the shipped code — trust it over
   any memory of what it used to say, and keep amending it (`docs(plan): …`) whenever code deviates.

The branch is green as of Task 6: `tsc` · `lint` · **319 unit** (25 files) · **75 e2e** (last full run at
Task 3). `next build` has not been run since Task 3 — run it before the first commit of the next session
if a dev server isn't up, since CSS errors only surface there.

**Nothing is half-finished in the code.** Every task ended on a green commit. The next unit of work is a
whole task, not a fragment.

## 1. What this project is

Building "Backroom IT — Inventory v2" from scratch for The Backroom Offshoring: an internal IT
asset-management app (purchase → assignment → repair → disposal) with an approval queue, an
append-only audit trail, four role-gated workspaces, and an offboarding wizard. **We are recreating
a high-fidelity HTML design prototype in a real Next.js codebase** — not porting the prototype's markup.

- **Repo:** github.com/neilluceromc/ChristianAuditing (**PUBLIC** — never commit secrets or `.env`)
- **Stack:** Next.js 15 App Router · PostgreSQL 16 (Docker) · Prisma 6 · Auth.js v5 · Tailwind v4 (CSS-var tokens)
- **Deploy:** single machine (the user's own device), one Docker Compose stack: `docker compose --profile prod up`
- **Machine:** Windows 11 · Node 24 · Docker Desktop · Postgres as container `inventory-db-1` (compose project `inventory`, loopback-only 127.0.0.1:5432)

## 2. How we work (follow this exactly — it is load-bearing, not ceremony)

One **plan per phase** under `docs/superpowers/plans/`, executed **subagent-driven**:

1. Write the phase plan with `superpowers:writing-plans` — bite-sized tasks, **full verbatim code in every step**, recorded scope decisions up front, entry criteria mapped to tasks.
2. Execute with `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`: **fresh implementer subagent per task** (paste the full task text into the prompt — never "go read the plan"), then review. Small/verbatim tasks get one fresh-eyes **spec review (sonnet)**; security-, concurrency- or logic-critical tasks get an **opus quality review**.
3. **The controller applies review fixes** for small, well-understood defects directly and verifies live in the Browser pane; larger fixes go back to an implementer subagent.
4. **Amend the plan doc whenever code deviates** (commit as `docs(plan): …`) so the plan never lies to a future reader.
5. Finish with `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` → merge to main, delete branch, push.

**Models:** sonnet implementers and spec reviewers; opus for quality reviews of anything that moves
data or gates access. **Verbatim implementers transfer plan defects wholesale — the reviews are where
correctness actually comes from.** Across five phases they caught: a working auth bypass (`a%` in the
email field logging in as admin), a fail-open authorization default, a signup enumeration oracle, a
focus trap that never installed, a bulk transaction that would time out at its own documented cap,
phantom audit entries on every first edit of a seeded asset, ciphertext that wasn't bound to its row,
and an execution path that could strand an approval in APPROVED forever.

Phase 7 added three more, and all three were defects in the **plan** rather than the implementation —
which is the argument for reviewing the rule and not just the diff: a decision from a previous holding
that hid an item still needing collection; a wizard billing years-old returns to a farewell report; and
a completion gate that shared two thirds of the definition of "decided" while its comment claimed all of
it. See §6.

**Recorded deviation from the skills:** work happens **in-place on a `phase-N-<name>` branch**, not a
git worktree — the repo root IS the app root and this is a single workstream. Commit style
`feat(scope): …` / `fix(scope): …` / `docs(plan): …`, co-author trailer
`Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## 3. Environment / how to run

- **DB:** `docker compose up -d db`. Seed: `npm run db:seed` (TRUNCATE + reseed — the sanctioned reset; **`prisma migrate reset` is blocked by the harness classifier and unnecessary**). **7 migrations** as of the Phase 7 branch; add new ones as hand-written SQL dirs, then `npx prisma migrate deploy && npx prisma generate` (`migrate dev` also works but invents a name). **A reseed TRUNCATEs, so a migration's backfill does not survive it** — anything the app depends on has to be set by `prisma/seed.ts` too (`Employee.offboardingAt` is set both ways for exactly this reason).
- **Dev app:** never via Bash — use the Browser-pane preview (`preview_start` name `app-dev`, port 3000). The controller owns this server; subagents must not start one.
- **Worker:** `npm run worker` (poll loop) or `npm run worker:once` (drain and exit — what e2e uses). In prod it's the compose `worker` service.
- **NEVER run `npm run build` while a dev server is running** — they share `.next` and it bricks the dev server.
- **Full battery:** `npx tsc --noEmit && npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build`, then `npm run db:seed && npx playwright test --workers=1`. The e2e run takes ~5 minutes; **run it in the foreground with a long timeout.** A backgrounded Playwright run that is never reaped keeps its own `beforeAll` reseed racing yours, which produces FK/unique errors and a cascade of unrelated timeouts in specs that pass in isolation — diagnose by listing live `node.exe` command lines, not by editing assertions.
- **Seeded accounts** (all `@thebackroomop.com`, password `ChangeMe123!`): `admin@` (admin, permanent) · `it@` (it_staff) · `purchasing@` (purchasing_staff) · `finance@` (finance_staff) · `viewer@` (viewer).
- **Seed contents:** 22 assets (all 8 statuses), 10 employees (Marites EMP-0042 holds 4 items against the only equipment policy → 1 gap; Dennis EMP-0090 is OFFBOARDING; Nina EMP-0097 has a reserved monitor), 7 approvals (all 6 states; APR-2040 past SLA → badge reads "3, urgent"; APR-2035 is APPROVED with a **deliberately malformed payload** + a queued job — the worker's EXECUTION_FAILED demo), 5 PRs (one per state; **PR-0198 is the bounce-back with a three-party note thread**, still the fixture the purchasing e2e leans on; `purchase_request_ref_seq` sits at 201 so the first drafted ref is PR-0202), 4 reservations. **On the Phase 7 branch:** 25 assets (Dennis EMP-0090 holds `BR-LT-0166` / `BR-PH-0312` / `BR-HS-0510`), and every non-ACTIVE employee carries `offboardingAt = day(-3)`.

## 4. What's DONE (Phases 1–6 on main; Phase 7 tasks 1–6 on the branch)

**Phase 1 — Foundation:** design tokens (light/dark, motion, reduced-motion kill switch); six-family
status system (`src/lib/status.ts`; `MISSING` is the 8th AssetStatus → fault); full Prisma schema
(append-only triggers on AuditEntry/NoteEntry, partial uniques, refNo sequences); seed; ~34 UI
primitives in `src/components/ui/`; `/dev/kitchen-sink` (404s in prod).

**Phase 2 — Auth + Shell:** Auth.js v5 (credentials; Entra registered only when fully configured);
**three-layer authorization** — edge middleware (JWT-only) → DB-backed `requireUser`/`requireRole` →
UI nav filtering, all from one truth module (`src/lib/workspaces.ts`, default-deny path gating);
login/signup/bootstrap; four workspace sidebars + switcher + topbar + mobile drawer + ⌘K palette;
cookie-driven SSR theme/density/workspace.

**Phase 3 — IT core** (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-16-phase-3-it-core.md`): the full `/inventory`
surface (facets/sort/chips/bulk-select → approval-creating bulk drawer/CSV export/column prefs; new;
record with Overview/History/Timeline/Documents/Secrets/Reservations; edit), the full `/employees`
surface (Items+Loadout columns, **the loadout view**, edit with M365 canonical+custom, timeline,
printable accountability form), reference-data CRUD ×3.

**Phase 4 — Approvals + audit** (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-phase-4-approvals-audit.md`): the
claim-based queue (five tabs, J/K/C/A/R/E + screen-reader live region), the detail page (live system
checks, Approve-only-after-claim, background-pending + EXECUTION_FAILED cards with verbatim worker
errors, Retry), **the worker** (atomic `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` lease, stale recovery, `--once`,
per-type live re-validation inside the execution tx, state-guarded terminal writes, catch-all →
EXECUTION_FAILED so nothing strands in APPROVED), `/audit` (zero row actions by design), and the
ActivityFeed renderer powering the two scoped feeds.

**Phase 5 — Purchasing** (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-phase-5-purchasing.md`): the three-party handoff made real —
`purchaseTransition` (brief §6.1, pure + TDD) driving six state-guarded server actions, each appending a **NoteEntry**
in the same transaction; `/purchases` (tabs write `?state=`, dwell second line under State), `/purchases/new` +
`/purchases/[id]/edit` (multi-unit editable rows, autosaved DRAFT created by the first save, "add from a policy
loadout", centavo-safe prices), `/purchases/[id]` (**the bounce-back**: red-left-bordered banner naming who sent it
back with the verbatim reason and `IT_REVIEWED → SUBMITTED · nothing was cleared`, a 4-stop stepper whose return path
is a dashed "← sent back" connector, `NOW · 2nd time`, per-unit states, the IT slot editor and Finance unit editor
inline), and `/purchases/activity`. **IT gained access to `/purchases`** — brief §6.1 makes IT the second party, and
`it-review`/`it-reject` were otherwise unreachable for `it_staff` (see §7).

**Phase 6 — Finance + Home** (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-17-phase-6-finance-home.md`): the role-aware
dashboards. Every section loads through `safeSection` and renders through `SectionCard`, so one failing query
shows the designed FAILED card while the rest of the page renders. IT Home has **no KPI row** — "Your shift"
(5 rows ordered by what breaks first, each clearable for the rest of the day via a `UserPreference`), Claimed-by-you
above the pool, the Fleet bar with its coverage line, the 5-bucket Age histogram, and the Warranty runway that
marks two identical laptops expiring the same week. Purchasing Home leads with a to-do list and spend; **Finance
Home leads with money and age**; Viewer gets the same layout minus the queue. Focus mode is the `br.focus` cookie.
Plus `/finance/assets` (the capitalized register with value columns) and `/finance/activity` (the one cross-domain
scoped feed, so the only one showing the domain pill).

**Phase 7 — offboarding + repairs + policies (IN PROGRESS, tasks 1–6 of 15 committed on
`phase-7-offboarding`).** Everything below is done and reviewed:

- **`lifecycle.return` learned four outcomes** (`SPARE | DEFECTIVE | BUYOUT | MISSING`, always clearing
  the holder) so the wizard's Defective / Buyout / Missing decisions execute instead of dying as
  `EXECUTION_FAILED`. Widening the producer meant fixing its two READERS as well: the queue's change-cell
  summary and the approval detail's "Return target" check both had `SPARE` hard-coded.
- **`src/lib/offboarding.ts`** — the phase's vocabulary and rules, pure and TDD'd: `OUTCOMES` /
  `OUTCOME_STATUS` / `reasonRequired`, the four `WIZARD_STEPS` + `parseStep`, `canContinue`,
  `reportTotals`, and the derivation trio `outcomeOfStatus` / `returnTargetStatus` / `decisionOf`.
- **`Employee.offboardingAt`** (migration `20260818090000_employee_offboarding_anchor`) — the anchor that
  makes "this offboarding" a real window. Stamped by `updateEmployee` when employment enters
  `OFFBOARDING`, cleared on a return to `ACTIVE`, kept once `OFFBOARDED` so the report stays readable.
- **`src/server/modules/offboarding/queries.ts`** — `listOffboarding` (the queue) and `getWizard`
  (everything one wizard needs, including the policy slots via the Phase 3 `computeLoadout`), sharing one
  windowed derivation through the exported `candidatesFor`.
- **`src/server/modules/offboarding/actions.ts`** — `decideItem` (one approval per decision,
  immediately), `closeAccounts` (guarded partial update of `m365Status`), `completeOffboarding`
  (person-only; refuses while anything is undecided, while any return sits `EXECUTION_FAILED`, or while
  the M365 account is still live).
- The seed's offboarding fixture **holds equipment**: Dennis Ong EMP-0090 now has `BR-LT-0166` (₱48,000),
  `BR-PH-0312` (₱18,000) and `BR-HS-0510` (₱5,500). Fleet 22 → 25, which moved two Home assertions.

### Conventions every later phase must follow

| Concern | Where |
|---|---|
| Mutation shape | `actionRole` guard → `checkRate` → zod → tx (domain write + `writeAudit` together) → `revalidatePath` → `ActionResult` |
| Typed results / guards | `src/server/action-result.ts` · `src/server/auth/guards.ts` (`actionRole`/`actionUser` return null, never redirect) |
| Audit | `writeAudit(tx, …)` + `diffOf` — day-precision date compare in `updateAsset` is the template for avoiding phantom diffs |
| State machines | Pure + TDD'd first (`src/lib/approval-flow.ts` is the template), called via **state-guarded `updateMany`** (count 0 → conflict) |
| List state | URL search params via `src/lib/url-state.ts`; column prefs are per-user DB rows, never URL |
| Lifecycle changes | Never a direct asset write — create an Approval; the worker executes it |
| Secrets | AES-256-GCM **v1: base64(version‖iv‖tag‖data), AAD = `"assetId:label"`** |
| Purchase transitions | `runTransition` in `src/server/modules/purchases/actions.ts` — pure check → state-guarded `updateMany` → **NoteEntry append** → `writeAudit`, all in one tx; `asActionResult` maps P2028 → conflict |
| Partial updates | Write **only the fields the caller sent**, and put each written field's before-value in the `updateMany` guard — filling untouched fields from the row you read loses concurrent edits silently (Phase 5's `saveUnit`) |
| Dashboard sections | `safeSection(label, run)` → `SectionCard` — a failing query becomes a typed failure and the designed FAILED card, never a blank page |
| Per-user, per-day UI state | a `UserPreference` row (`home:dismissed`), reset by a date change — not an audited domain event |
| DB invariants to catch (P2002 → typed conflict) | `Approval_one_open_per_asset` (one open approval per asset) · `Job_one_live_execute_per_approval` (one live execute-job per approval) · `Reservation_one_active_hold_per_asset` |
| Derived state beats stored state | "Decided" is read out of the approvals that exist (`decisionOf`), not kept in a wizard table — which is what makes a half-finished offboarding N correct records instead of a lost session |
| A derived predicate is only shared if ALL of it is shared | Phase 7 extracted `groupCandidates` but left the *window* duplicated, and the server gate promptly disagreed with the UI. `candidatesFor` now owns window + grouping together, and all three call sites use it |
| A facet SQL can't express | narrow to a candidate set in the `where`, then make the final cut in memory with the same pure function that renders it (`repairStage`, Task 11) — never two rules for one concept |

---

## 5. What REMAINS

- **Phase 7 — tasks 7–15 of the plan** (in order; each is fully written with verbatim code):
  **7** `/offboarding` queue page (+ Home's `LEAVE` row opens the wizard) · **8** the wizard's four
  components (step bar, the 4-way decision control, accounts panel, complete dialog — plus one change to
  `SegmentedControl` so "undecided" doesn't render as "Returned") · **9** the 4-step wizard page ·
  **10** the printable farewell report · **11** the repairs brain (`src/lib/repairs.ts`, the `stage`
  facet, two seed fixtures, and the worker's `defectiveSince` stamp) · **12** repair mode on the
  inventory list (stage chips, Down column, quote warning, the `HOLD` marker) · **13** `/reservations` ·
  **14** `/admin/equipment-policies` · **15** the e2e spec, cleanup, full battery, close-out.
- **Phase 8 — Admin + import/export + polish.** `/admin/users` (locked permanent admin),
  `/admin/webhooks` + `/deliveries` (dead-letter replay — **the worker currently dead-letters
  DELIVER_WEBHOOK jobs with "ships in Phase 8"**), `/admin/flags`; import (3-step dry-run → commit,
  blocked rows grouped by cause), export upgrade (real Excel + split-by-year chips, including the
  brief's `farewell-report` export route), printable label sheet, USB-scanner polish (a scan should tick
  the matching wizard row), deployment README, full axe pass. Entra SSO wiring lands here or is
  explicitly deferred.

---

## 6. Phase 7 mid-flight: the rules tasks 1–6 established (READ BEFORE TASK 7)

The plan's own **Recorded scope decisions** section is the full list (15 of them). These are the ones a
later task can silently break, all of them discovered by review rather than by tests:

1. **`Employee.offboardingAt` bounds "this offboarding".** The `−` button on an employee record creates a
   `lifecycle.return` on every routine laptop swap, so a read scoped only by `employeeId` bills equipment
   handed back years ago to a farewell report — a signed financial document — and folds its cost into the
   value recovered. Never query return approvals for a wizard without the window.
2. **`candidatesFor(employee, approvals)` owns the window AND the grouping.** "Decided" is three things:
   the window, the grouping, and `decisionOf`. Sharing two of them is how the completion gate came to
   disagree with the wizard. Every reader — the queue, the wizard, the completion gate — goes through
   this one function. A null anchor means no window, so nothing historical is decided; that is the safe
   direction and both sides agree on it.
3. **`decisionOf(candidates, { held })` treats the newest EXECUTED return as a BOUNDARY.** `executionPlan`
   hard-codes `assigneeId: null`, so an EXECUTED return provably means the asset left that person's name.
   If they hold it now, that return — and everything older — decided an EARLIER holding. An
   `EXECUTION_FAILED` *after* the boundary is deliberately kept: it never moved the asset, so it is still
   this holding's live, retryable decision.
4. **An open approval only BLOCKS an item if it isn't that item's own decision** (`blockedBy`, compared by
   refNo). The one-open-approval-per-asset index is per **asset, not per type**, so a pending
   `lifecycle.change-status` — or a pre-window return — owns the slot and makes the item undecidable.
   Both the wizard row and `decideItem`'s refusal must NAME that request; "that decision is already
   recorded" is a lie when the wizard shows the item as open.
5. **`completeOffboarding` gates on three things**: nothing undecided (via rule 2), no return sitting in
   `EXECUTION_FAILED` (a failed return never moved the asset, and the person is about to drop out of the
   queue where anyone would notice), and the M365 account closed (case-folded — README 4f stores
   client-defined values as-is). It writes the decision set into the audit diff, because `AuditEntry` is
   the only immutable table and a later rejection would otherwise silently rewrite the report.
6. **`Missing` is first-class and undecided is not Returned.** A reason is required for anything but
   Returned; Continue is blocked while any item is undecided; and `SegmentedControl` draws no indicator
   when nothing is chosen, so an undecided row cannot read as "Returned".
7. **The wizard produces approvals and never writes an asset.** Completion touches the person only.
8. **Reuse the Phase 3 loadout brain** (`computeLoadout` / `resolvePolicy`) — `getWizard` already does.
9. **Viewer reaches these pages deliberately** and must see them read-only with the `READ-ONLY · VIEWER`
   badge — mutating affordances absent, not disabled. Do not "harden" the pages into `requireRole`; the
   actions already refuse a viewer independently.

### What the three review findings should teach the next session

None of the three bugs above (rules 1, 2, 3) could have been caught by the unit suite or by seed-based
e2e, because **no fixture had a prior return**. Each was found by an opus reviewer asked "is the RULE
right?" rather than "does this match the plan?". Two of them were defects in the plan, not the
implementation. So: keep the two-stage review, and when a task is logic-critical, point the reviewer at
the *rule* and give it the domain facts (the unique index, what `executionPlan` guarantees, what the
seed does and doesn't contain). Mutation-testing the new tests — reverse a comparator, weaken a filter,
see whether anything fails — caught two tests that passed for the wrong reason.

---

## 7. Recurring gotchas that have cost real time

- **Prisma `mode: "insensitive"` on an identity/`equals` field compiles to ILIKE**, making `%`/`_` wildcards — caused an auth bypass AND an enumeration oracle. Use `findUnique` on a normalized value. `contains`-search is the sanctioned use.
- **Installing any npm package on Windows** drops the Linux optional-dep trees (`@tailwindcss/oxide-wasm32-wasi`, `@emnapi/*`) from `package-lock.json` and breaks the Alpine prod `npm ci`. Regenerate inside Linux: `docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/app" -w //app node:22-alpine sh -c "npm i -g npm@11 && npm install --package-lock-only --no-audit --no-fund"` (Git Bash needs `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` and `//app`).
- **`auth()` immediately after `signIn(…, {redirect:false})`** in the same action returns a stale session — read from the DB instead.
- **Non-component exports from a `"use client"` module are not values on the server** — a server page importing an array from a client file gets a reference proxy and crashes at runtime; tsc and lint both pass. Shared constants live in `src/lib/`.
- **Reseeding invalidates every session** (new user ids). Stale JWTs escape via `GET /logout`, which clears the cookie; `requireUser` redirects there. Without it the login bounce loops forever.
- **Playwright: `--workers=1`, and every DB-touching spec file reseeds in `beforeAll`** — the files share one database and alphabetical order otherwise leaks state (approvals-audit deploys an asset and drains the badge that auth-shell asserts).
- **Prisma interactive transactions default to a 5s budget** — batch per-row loops (`createMany`, one `generate_series` nextval call) instead of N sequential round trips.
- **Seed payloads must mirror what the real producers write.** A seeded approval using `to.assignee` (an employeeNo) instead of `to.assigneeId` (a row id) made the happy-path demo item fail execution honestly but confusingly.
- **CSS syntax errors only surface at `npm run build`** — tsc and lint sail past a stray brace. That's what the full battery is for; run it before every merge.
- **Reviewers are usually right but occasionally wrong about repo facts.** One review asserted a migration didn't exist when it did. Verify claims against the migrations and the live DB before acting on them — then fix the real finding underneath.
- **Browser-pane quirks:** synthetic clicks often don't reach React handlers — dispatch a real bubbling `MouseEvent`/`KeyboardEvent` from `javascript_tool`, or use `form.requestSubmit()`. The sidebar only renders at `lg:` — use a 1280px viewport. Background reviewers may stop the dev server; `preview_list` and restart before the next live check.
- **Rows created in one transaction share a `createdAt` millisecond**, so `orderBy: { createdAt: "asc" }` alone is NOT a stable order — Postgres may return them either way between reads. Phase 5 shipped a bug where this flipped which purchase line was "unit 1", corrupting the `unit-N` anchors. Always add an `id` tiebreaker.
- **A partial update must write only the fields the caller sent, and guard each on its before-value.** Filling untouched fields from the row you read (`specs ?? unit.specs`) rewrites them with a value that is already stale under READ COMMITTED — two people editing different fields of one row silently clobber each other, and a `diffOf` against the same stale row records no trace of it.
- **Prisma throws; it doesn't return.** Without a `try`/`catch` a P2028 (transaction couldn't get a connection — reachable with just two concurrent transactions) escapes as a 500 instead of the designed conflict banner. Every actions module needs the mapping.
- **Widening a path rule can leave an operation ungoverned.** Granting `/purchases` to the IT workspace made every role pass the path gate, so "who may create a request" stopped being answered by any layer until `DRAFT_ROLES` was added. When you widen a gate, ask which rule it was silently carrying.
- **A client-side navigation currently leaves the previous page's DOM in the document** (a second `<table>` outside `<main>`). Reproducible between two Phase-3 pages, so it predates Phase 5; observed in dev only, not investigated.
- **A long-lived dev server degrades the e2e suite into phantom failures.** After several full runs its resident memory climbed ~8.5GB → ~12.2GB and a different set of pre-existing specs failed each time, always as "clicked a link, the heading never arrived" — every one passing in isolation. Restart the preview before a confirmation run; the suite went 75/75 immediately afterwards.
- **A seeded fixture that doesn't exercise its own design is a silent gap.** Phase 6 found two: every asset shared one purchase date (so the five-bucket age histogram was one bar and the 4y+ amber could never render) and nothing expired inside the 90-day warranty window (so the clustered pair the design is about never appeared). When a screen's designed state can't occur against the seed, fix the seed — that is what it is for.
- **A Prisma filter cannot compare two columns.** A derived facet whose rule spans fields (repairs' `beyond-repair` = quote ≥ 60% of cost) either changes shape or narrows to a candidate set in SQL and gets its final cut in memory from the same pure function that renders it. Two rules for one concept is the failure mode.
- **Widening one end of a pipeline means auditing its readers.** Teaching `lifecycle.return` four outcomes also required fixing `summarizeApproval` and the "Return target" system check, both of which had `SPARE` hard-coded — and a third reader (`summarizeApproval`'s `?? "SPARE"` fallback) that invented a target for the one payload with none, contradicting the check rendered one card away.
- **A new audit `action` string is invisible to the display layer until you teach it.** `auditSentence` falls through to a raw default and `actionDot` matches exact strings, so `offboarding.completed` rendered as "X offboarding.completed Y" with a neutral dot until both were extended.
- **Returning a failure from a `$transaction` callback COMMITS it** — only a throw rolls back. Every `return conflict(...)` in the offboarding actions precedes every write, which is what makes them safe; adding a write before one would commit silently.
- **Mutation-test a new pure rule before trusting its tests.** Reversing a comparator and weakening a filter both left Phase 7's `decisionOf` suite fully green; the weakened version silently produced a `Decision` with `outcome: null` and a receipt with `undefined` money keys. Five targeted rows now kill five distinct mutations.
- **`design_handover/` is excluded from lint/build** and must stay untouched — it's the source of truth, not code.

## 8. Deferred / out-of-scope (tracked, don't lose)

- **Phase 4 leftovers:** `/approvals` shows the first 50 rows of a tab with a "showing N of M" hint but no pagination; no admin surface reads the `Job` table (Phase 8's deliveries page is the natural home); the worker's stale-lease recovery uses a 5-minute wall-clock heuristic (safe now because every terminal write is state-guarded).
- **Phase 5 leftovers:** the draft autosave churns unit rows (`createDraft`/`saveDraft` return only request-level fields, so `/purchases/new` never learns the unit ids it just created and every later autosave deletes and recreates the set — `/purchases/[id]/edit` does pass real ids and updates in place); `/purchases` has no sortable headers or column chooser; the ⌘K palette now returns purchase requests to `it_staff` and `viewer`, and the detail page shows money and finance notes to anyone who can reach it (no field-level restriction was specified); `addComment` deliberately still accepts comments on COMPLETED/CANCELLED requests.
- **Settled 2026-08-17 — "Admin" means system administration, and the procurement department is just Purchasing.** No renaming is pending: the `Admin` workspace (Users & roles / Webhooks / Feature flags) is software settings, the `admin` role is the superuser, and the procurement workspace is `Purchasing` as built. Recorded only so nobody re-opens it.
- **Phase 6 leftovers:** the Admin workspace has no Home of its own (`ws === "admin"` falls through to the IT layout, so an admin sees SLA breaches and fleet composition under a Users/Webhooks/Flags sidebar); "Retry this section" refreshes the whole route because RSC has no per-section refetch; section degradation is loader-level, so a render-time bug inside a section still escapes to the route error boundary; `/finance/assets` has no search, no sortable headers and no book-value column (depreciation is a policy nobody has stated); Home's `DATA` rows key on `DATA:<assetId>`, which is unambiguous only while an asset can't be both MISSING and DEPLOYED-without-a-holder.
- **Phase 3 leftovers:** CSV export buffers up to 10k rows in memory and silently truncates `?ids=` beyond 500; sort remount drops keyboard focus to `<body>`; `EntityCombobox` lacks a listbox accessible name and Home/End.
- **Phase 7 so far:** a 3-character reason minimum accepts invisible characters (`trim()` strips Unicode `Zs` but not U+200B/U+2060), so a MISSING item can carry a blank-looking justification — shared with `requestReturn` and `rejectApproval`, so the fix is one zod refinement in a shared helper, not a per-action patch; four separate copies of "read a string field off a `Prisma.JsonValue`" (`obj`/`str` in `approval-execution.ts`, `returnTargetStatus`, `payloadReason`, and the `target` hoist in `approvals/queries.ts`) agree today and could be one exported pair; `getWizard` reads assets and approvals as two statements, so a worker commit between them shows an item as undecided for one render (self-correcting, and `decideItem` refuses with its designed conflict — closing it needs `RepeatableRead`, i.e. a transaction per render, which was declined deliberately); an empty policy slot on a leaver reads "not held" but does not yet distinguish "already returned" from "left their name with no return at all".
- Entra SSO real wiring (needs tenant creds). Real product photography, brand mark, barcode generation (striped placeholders today). Off-device backups (nightly `pg_dump` to a local volume ships; copying elsewhere is the user's call). HR review of the accountability-form acknowledgement copy. `WebhookEndpoint.secret` encryption (Phase 8). CI workflow + jsdom component tests (declined in Phase 1, revisitable).
